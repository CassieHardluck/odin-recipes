    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <P>Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Eum, culpa.</P>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>32 ounces cottage cheese</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li> ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the noodles, drain and transfer to a prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>    
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>   
    </ol>
